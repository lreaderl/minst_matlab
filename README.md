# minst_matlab
## Introduction
* Run on MATLAB R2018a, with Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox and Computer Vision System Toolbox and Neural Network Toolbox Model for AlexNet Network 
* Model: AlexNet feartures based SVM Classification
## Run
* For train: run ```Train(path_to_train_images, path_to_train_labels, path_to_test_images, path_to_test_labels);```
* For test: run ```Test(imgPath, modelPath);```
## Grade
* Now, the best score on svm method is 99.43%, finding no where to improve without neural network
